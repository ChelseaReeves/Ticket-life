<h1>osTicket - Ticket Life Examples</h1>
In this tutorial I will go through the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution with the help desk ticketing system osTicket..<br />

<h2>Ticket Life Cycle</h2>
<p>To initiate the ticket creation process, users are required to access the osTicket portal and log in. Inside the portal, providing thorough details about their IT issues. Here I have created three tickets covering potential issues in a real-world environment. These tickets are crafted by specifying a help topic, offering a descriptive overview, and outlining the particulars of the issue.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of an admin, incoming ticket requests are delivered to their dashboard for prompt attention. The admins can reassign tickets to authorized agents or teams based on expertise. The severity level of the issue is determined and assigned, ensuring that all tickets falling within the Service Level Agreement (SLA) are addressed with accuracy. In these examples, the admins has reviewed the tickets, reassigned them to the relevant teams, and adjusted the severity levels accordingly.</p>

<p>When resolving tickets, effective communication plays a crucial role in connecting with both the internal team and the users experiencing the issues. In one of the examples, once the ticket was reassigned it was handled, resolved and subsequently closed. The impact of documentation holds significant importance in maintaining a productive environment. Additionally, the documentation of resolved tickets serves as a valuable point of reference in case a similar issue arises in the future.</p>
